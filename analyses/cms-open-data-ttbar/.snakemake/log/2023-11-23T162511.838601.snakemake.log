    * Absolute path "/bin/bash -l -c && source fix-env.sh && papermill {input} sample1_out.ipynb {output} -p selected_sample={params.selected_sample} -p merged_step='No' -k python3" in line 25:
      Do not define absolute paths inside of the workflow, since this renders your workflow irreproducible on other machines. Use path relative to the working directory instead, or make the path configurable via a config file.

Lints for rule ttbar_nominal_sample (line 21, /home/andrii/Documents/Reana_local/analysis-grand-challenge/analyses/cms-open-data-ttbar/Snakefile):
    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover. In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become unreadable.
